## Production todo-redux

 In this exercise you will gain more experience using code bases you are unfamiliar with. The exercise lacks any guidance or steps so you are truly on your own! Your goal is to take the todo-redux app you built yesterday and accomplish the following.

 - Get all the app features working in the production setup you used for hangman
    - Hint: copy the folders and start deleting and copying!
 - Once everything is working finish the filter bonus from yesterday if you havent yet.
 - Now that the filter feature is working the next challenge is to use react router and anchor tags so that filtering happens on different routes. See the gif below.
    - Note: The url should show the current filter.
