# Express

Express is a web app framework for Node.js. Some cool things you can do with Express are:

> - Write handlers for requests with different HTTP verbs at different URL paths (routes).
> - Integrate with "view" rendering engines in order to generate responses by inserting data into templates.
> - Set common web application settings like the port to use for connecting, and the location of templates that are used for rendering the response.
> - Add additional request processing "middleware" at any point within the request handling pipeline.
