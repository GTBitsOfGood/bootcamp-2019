# Express

In this section you will learn about Express. Express is a web app framework for Node.js. As described by [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Server-side/Express_Nodejs/Introduction), it lets you:
> - Write handlers for requests with different HTTP verbs at different URL paths (routes).
> - Integrate with "view" rendering engines in order to generate responses by inserting data into templates.
> - Set common web application settings like the port to use for connecting, and the location of templates that are used for rendering the response.
> - Add additional request processing "middleware" at any point within the request handling pipeline.

dwai if this doesn't totally make sense yet.
