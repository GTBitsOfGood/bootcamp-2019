# The Vault

## Goal

In this exercise we're going to implement a web app with user logins using
[Passport](http://passportjs.org/). We're going implement sessions using
in progressively more secure ways.


## Instructions

Work in `09_passport_oauth/4_vault` directory. You'll need to add code to `app.js`.

:warning:The order of middleware functions in `app.js` matters.  We've given you
place markers for setup steps in `app.js`. Make sure to use these markers when
inserting code.:warning:

## Part 1. Local Strategy

[Passport](http://passportjs.org/) is an NPM package that makes it easy to
implement authentication (i.e. user logins) in your app.

To start with we're going to use the file `passwords.plain.json` as our user
database. This file includes a set of user accounts and passwords. We're going
to allow user logins based on information stored here.

Here are the steps to follow:

1. Install required dependencies for the project - we've listed those in the `package.json` file. (In general, you'll want to do this for all npm-based exercises)
    - Use `npm install`
2. Install `passport` and the `passport-local` modules.
    - Use `npm install --save`
    - `require()` `passport` and `passport-local` in `app.js` (refer to Passport docs on properly doing this)
3. Write a `LocalStrategy` similar to the one in [Passport docs](http://passportjs.org/docs#strategies)

    - Authenticate users using `passwords.plain.json`.
      Your strategy will read this file into a variable, and check to see the the user who
      is trying to login is in your local password file. You can read json files with
      `require()`:

      ```javascript
      require('./passwords.plain.json')
      ```

    - A `LocalStrategy` takes a `function(username, password, done) {}`.
      This function should read passwords from json, check them and signal to passport success or failure
      using the `done()` function. Like so:

      ![](img/local.png)

4. Add passport into your application with [`passport.initialize()` and `passport.session()`](http://passportjs.org/docs#middleware):

    ![](img/passportInit.png)

5. Create the route `GET /` and render `index.hbs` (`index.hbs` is already provided)
6. Create the route `GET /login` and render `login.hbs` (`login.hbs` is already provided)
7. Create the route `POST /login` and call `passport.authenticate('local')`.

   When a user successfully logs in they should be sent to '/' so set
   `successRedirect` to `'/'`.

   If a user fails to log in they should be sent back to '/login' to retry,
   so set `failureRedirect` to `'/login'`.

   ![](img/login.png)

8. Tell `passport` how to store users in the session with `passport.serializeUser()`.

    `serializeUser` takes a `function(user, done){}`. We use `done()` to send
    back to passport what part of our user we want to store in the session. In our case,
    this is `user._id`. Passport calls the serialize function the first time a user logs in, before the session
    is updated. We write serialize(), but trust passport to use it properly.

    ![](img/serialize.png)

9. You can verify that your code is working correctly by:
    - Go to http://localhost:3000/login and try to log in using
      usernames and passwords from `passwords.plain.json`
    - Successful login should take you to http://localhost:3000/
      (:warning:Your username won't show up yet. We'll fix this in Part
      2.:warning:)
    - Unsuccessful login should take you to http://localhost:3000/login

## Part 2. Sessions with Cookie Session

Once you've got the local strategy working, let's get sessions working as well.

In a typical web application, the credentials used to authenticate a user will
only be transmitted during the login request. If authentication succeeds, a
session will be established and maintained via a cookie set in the user's
browser.  Each subsequent request will not contain credentials, but rather the
unique cookie that identifies the session. This is why you can login and stay
logged in!


1. Install `cookie-session` with `npm` - remember to `--save`!
1. Add `cookie-session` to your app as middleware with `app.use()`.

   Use `keys` to pick a secret string to protect your cookies by generating
   cryptographic signatures.

   Use `maxAge` to specify how long a cookie should be valid for. By
   specifying how long a cookie should last, we can control how much we want a
   user to relogin.  Some sites will set this cookie to last for a very long
   time, this is why you are always logged in. By default, maxAge is set to
   expire when the session ends (when all tabs with the current domain are closed).
   Set max age to be 2 minutes from now (`maxAge:1000*60*2` milliseconds).

   ![](img/cookieSession.png)

1. Tell `passport` how to read users from the session with `passport.deserializeUser()`.

    `deserializeUser` takes a `function(id, done){}`.
    Passport calls this function every time a logged-in user arrives to populate
    `req.user` with all the information about the user.
    We call `done()` with the user we get back from `passwords.plain.json`.

    ![](img/deserialize.png)

1. Update the `GET /` route
    1. If `req.user` is falsy, it means the user has not yet logged in.
   `res.redirect()` them to `/login` so they can log in.
    1. If `req.user` is truthy, pass `{user: req.user}` to `res.render()` when
   rendering `index.hbs`. Now you should see the username after login:

        ![](img/indexUsername.png)

1. Create the route `GET /logout` which should call `req.logout()` and then
redirect to `/`:

    ![](img/logout.png)

1. Verify that you've completed this step with:
    1. Login then click the logout link, it should take you to `/login`
    1. Try to visit `/` when you're not logged in it should take you to
      `/login`.
    1. Now you should see two new cookies in your browser: `session` and
      `session.sig`. `session` stores all the information about your session and
      `session.sig` is a cryptographic signature of your session that proves to
      the server that you have not tampered with your session. The cryptographic
      signature is created using the secret key in the server.

        You can view cookies in the Application tab of Chrome Developer tools.

        ![](img/cookie.png)

    1. Change `maxAge` for cookie session to 10 seconds. Login, wait 10 seconds,
    refresh you page, it should take you to `/login`.

# Part 3.1: Setup MongoDb

Create a database in mLab. Connect to it in your `app.js`:

  Remember to store your `MONGODB_URI` in `env.sh`

![](img/mongoSetup.png)

# Part 3.2: Make sessions persistent

If you want to keep your sessions completely confidential, `cookie-session`
isn't for you.  You can read the contents of your session using the builtin
`atob()` function.  Try this in your DevTools console: copy the value of your
`session` cookie then call `atob('cookie value here')`.

We can store session information in MongoDb, where it's hidden from the user,
with `express-session`.

1. Remove the old `session` and `app.use(session...` code. You don't need it
  anymore.
1. Install `express-session` with npm.
1. Add `express-session` to your app.

    ![](img/expressSession.png)

1. Verify that your logins still work. But now, when you restart `node` you should be
  logged out.

    These sessions are now stored in `node`. But everytime `node` restarts it forgets
    everything, so you're logged out. Now let's make sessions stick around i.e. persist
    using our database, MognoDb.

1. Install the [`connect-mongo`](https://github.com/jdesboeufs/connect-mongo)
  npm package, this is how we will connect our sessions to MongoDb.
1. Set the `store` property of `express-session` to use `connect-mongo` now.

    ![](img/mongoSession.png)

1. Verify that your sessions don't die by logging in and restarting `node`. You should
  stay logged in!
1. You should now see a new Collection in mLab names `sessions`. This is where your
  sessions are stored now. Try deleting these and see if you get logged out as a result.

## Part 4.1: Hashing

Storing passwords in your database in plain text (i.e. unencrypted) is not
secure. Your users probably reuse their passwords accross many websites. If your
database is hacked, now the hackers can hack your users across many websites. To
mitigate this problem we `hash` passwords before storing them. Hashing is like
encrypting, but irreversible. In other words, given the hashed version of
password, it's nearly impossible to get the original password back.

1. Implement the `hashPassword()` `app.js` using the `sha256` algorithm.
   (`sha256` is not the most secure password hash function, we're going to learn
   better ones later this week):

    ![](img/hashPassword.png)

1. Type in your `hashPassword()` functions to a Node console (just type `node` to start) and try
  hashing a couple passwords from `passwords.plain.json` - note how
  these match up with `passwords.hashed.json`. (Hint: type the require statement first, then type the whole function in one line - the console doesn't support multiline expressions well)

## Part 4.2: Hashed Passwords

Since hashing is irreversible, when a user tries to log in we `hash` the
the password they attempted to use, then we compare the hashed password we
stored when the user first registered. In JavaScript terms:

```javascript
function hash(password) {
  // apply hash function to password
}

if (hashPassword(passwordAttempt) === storedPasswordHash) {
  // Sucessful login
} else {
  // Fail login
}
```

Let's rewrite our `LocalStrategy` to use hashed passwords:

1. Read `passwords.hashed.json` instead of `passwords.plain.json`. Notice that you can't just compare the password sent to you from the browser (`req.body.password`) with a password in your local file. Instead, you will need to hash the password you receive to compare it with the hashed passwords in the database.
1. Before you look up a username and password in the JSON file, hash your password with the included
   `hashPassword()` function.

    ![](img/hashStrategy.png)

**Checkpoint** - Test your site by logging in and out again - there should be no problems if you followed the above steps correctly.

## Part 5.1: Storing users in MongoDb

Let's improve our passport strategy even more! Try storing user accounts in the
database.

1. Create a new `User` model in `models/models.js`
1. Create a new `GET /signup` route. Inside the route:

    - `res.render()` `signup.hbs`

1. Create a new `POST /signup` route. Inside the route:

    - Validates username and password fields from `req.body`
    - If validation passes, create a new user object and `.save()` it to MongoDb
    - After the user is successfully saved to MongoDb, redirect to `/login`

1. Rewrite your `deserializeUser()` to use the new `User` model.
    Use `User.findById()`.

    ![](img/mongoDeserialize.png)

1. Rewrite your `LocalStrategy` to use the new `User` model.
  Use `User.findOne()` in conjunction `done()` to do logins.

    ![](img/mongoStrategy.png)

1. Verify that logins and logouts work as before.

## Part 5.2: Hashed passwords in MongoDb

Now let's do hashed passwords in MongoDb.

1. Change your user model to have a `hashedPassword` property
  instead of a `password` property. (Delete your old users in mLab.)
1. Update your `POST /signup` endpoint to apply the `hashPassword()`
  function to `req.body.password` before storing it in the model:

    ![](img/mongoHash.png)

1. Update your `LocalStrategy` to convert the input password into
  a hashed password as you did in Exercise 4. Then compare this
  value with the `hashedPassword` property of your users.
1. Verify that logins and logouts work as before.

Congrats! You have successfully built a (robust) login system!
