1. Edit `08_ajax_express/3_ajax_counter/app.js`
    1. Create a `POST /up` route. When this route is called, increase the global
    variable `count` by 1 and respond with a JSON object that indicates the new
    value:

        ```json
        { "count": 5 }
        ```
    1. Create a `POST /down` route. When this route is called, decrease the global
    variable `count` by 1 and respond with a JSON object that indicates the new
    value.
2. Edit `08_ajax_express/3_ajax_counter/views/index.hbs`
    1. Add a click handler to the `Up` button and make an AJAX request to
    `/up` with the method `POST`.

        If the request is successful update the counter on the page based
        on the response you get from the server.
