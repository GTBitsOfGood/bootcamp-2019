        It's high time you stopped digging through emails and Slack
        to find that message from your housemate. Communicate, upload files,
        add due dates, and plot to #DominateAllTheHouses, all within a
        Bofrello board.

        This is a Bofrello board. It's a list of lists filled with cards,
        used by your house or by yourself.
    </p>
    <img src="../img/home-hero.png" class="layout-fill-img"/>
    <p class="center-paragraph">
        Drag and drop cards between lists to show progress. Add as many
        people as you need and drag them to cards. Add and reorder lists
        as you need. <strong>Bofrello adapts to your project, house, and
        workflow.</strong>
    </p>
    <p class="center-paragraph">
        You’ll see everything about your project just by glancing at the
        board, and it all updates in real-time. There’s nothing to set
        up and everyone gets it instantly.

        Bofrello will never overwhelm you with features you won’t use. For
        those who want more out of their boards, there are Power-Ups like
        calendar, card aging, and voting, that you can turn on. It’s a way
        to offer more without cluttering things for everyone.
